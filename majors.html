		  <p>There are many majors for undergraduates at UW to explore! We have gathered some of the most popular majors for now at UW for you to consider(we will add more majors as we go).
		  <p><strong>Major Type Key:</strong>
		  <ul>
			<li><span class = "majorType">CC</span>: short for <em>"Capacity Constrained"</em>. Completing Pre-Requisites <span style = "text-decoration:underline">will not</span> guarantee admission
			to this major and usually admissions are competitive. There are specific admissions periods
			for each major, so keep an eye out for these dates.</li>
			<li><span class = "majorType">MR</span>: short for <em>"Minimum Requirement"</em>. Complete Pre-Requisites to declare it as a major.</li>
			<li><span class = "majorType">OM</span>: short for <em>"Open Major"</em>. The major will accept students at any time, provided
			they have good academic standing.</li>
		  </ul>
      <p><strong>Words of encouragement:</strong> While some of these majors seem to have an insurmountable number of scary pre-reqs and impossible
                                        to get into, we would like to point out that once you take these classes and you work for them, they won't look
                                        scary anymore. But plan accordingly and realistically(e.g taking 18 credit of just STEM related courses for
                                        Pre-Req in one quarter is a bad idea). Leave some rooms for other classes.
		  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The information below are subject to change as departments make changes or new majors are added. We will update them as there are changes.

  					<p>Most of students in Computer Science major enters via Direct Admission(roughly 50% to 55%) and transfer admission
               (roughly 15% to 20%). The department states that it leaves 30% of their spot for current UW students. Even though
               this percentage may seem doable to some, the applicant numbers are increasing each admission term and the
               CS department stated that these seats are mostly for UW students who found interest in CS after enrolling at UW.
               While the Current Student Admission rate is 20% to 25%, if you were not offered Direct Admission and planning to get in
               by Current Student Admission, the chances are extremely low. The Allen school says you should come to UW to study CS
               <strong>"only if you are willing to pursue a concentration in CS through [their] non-major courses"</strong>, if you are not a
               Direct Admit. Below are other options for Computer Science that you could focus on rather than CS at UW:
               <ul>
                 <li>Applied and Computational Mathematical Science(ACMS)</li>
                 <li>Informatics</li>
